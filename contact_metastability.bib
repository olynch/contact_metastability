	abstract = {In this paper we introduce a percolation construction which allows us to reduce problems about supercritical contact processes to problems about 1-dependent oriented percolation with density ppp close to 1. Using this method we obtain a number of results about the growth of supercritical contact processes and the wet region in oriented percolation. As a corollary to our results we find that the critical probability for oriented site percolation is greater than ({\textgreater}) that for bond percolation.},

	abstract = {In this paper a new approach to metastability for stochastic dynamics is proposed. The basic idea is to study the statistics of each path, performing time averages along the evolution. Metastability would be characterized by the fact that the process of these time averages converges, under a suitable rescaling, to a measure valued Markov jump process. Here this convergence is shown for the Curie-Weiss mean field dynamics and also for a model with spatial structure: Harris contact process.},

Put ξt(x)=1ξt(x)=1{\textbackslash}xi\_t(x) = 1 if x∈ξtx∈ξtx {\textbackslash}in {\textbackslash}xi\_t and 0 otherwise. The transition intensity for a change in ξt(x)ξt(x){\textbackslash}xi\_t(x) depends on \{ξt(y),y\{ξt(y),y{\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}xi\_t(y), y a neighbor of x\}x\}x{\textbackslash}\}. The chief concern is with "contact processes," where ξt(x)ξt(x){\textbackslash}xi\_t(x) can change from 0 to 1 only if ξt(y)=1ξt(y)=1{\textbackslash}xi\_t(y) = 1 for some yyy neighboring xxx. Let pt(ξ)=Prob\{ξt≠∅∣ξ0=ξ\}pt(ξ)=Prob⁡\{ξt≠∅∣ξ0=ξ\}p\_t({\textbackslash}xi) = {\textbackslash}operatorname\{Prob\} {\textbackslash}\{{\textbackslash}xi\_t {\textbackslash}neq {\textbackslash}varnothing {\textbackslash}mid {\textbackslash}xi\_0 = {\textbackslash}xi{\textbackslash}\}. Under appropriate conditions, ptptp\_t is increasing, subadditive, or submodular in ξξ{\textbackslash}xi. In the case of contact processes, conditions are giving implying that p∞(ξ)=0p∞(ξ)=0p\_{\textbackslash}infty({\textbackslash}xi) = 0 for all finite ξξ{\textbackslash}xi, or that the contrary is true. In other cases conditions for ergodicity are given.},
